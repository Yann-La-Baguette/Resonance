# Resonance
Resonance is an application that permit to transfer sound from a PC to a smartphone.

This app has an exe for Windows, and an apk file for android.

You need to launch the .exe on Windows and install the apk file on Android.

## Launching the app

An IP Adress is printed on Android application.

You need to enter this IP inside the windows application and then push the button to launch the streaming.

## Select sound source

You also can change the source of the sound. 

Due to a bug in Qt Creator, I currently can't use the sound outputs of a PC. I only can use the inputs, like Microphones or Audio Mix, which works like the input if you have it.

## Points of attention

You need to have the volume up on your PC for it to work.
